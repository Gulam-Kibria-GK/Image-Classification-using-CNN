## Introduction

The Image Classification using CNN project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, to classify images into predefined categories. With this system, users can train a model to recognize patterns and features in images, enabling automated image classification tasks.

## Files

1. **Dataset**: The dataset used for training the image classification model.
2. **Image Classification using CNN.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for building and training the CNN model.
3. **Image_Classification_model_1.h5**: Pre-trained model weights saved in HDF5 format.
4. **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (see [Dependencies](#dependencies)).
2. Open and run the `Image Classification using CNN.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the CNN model.
4. Optionally, load the pre-trained model weights from `Image_Classification_model_1.h5` for inference.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
